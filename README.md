# JavaCSVReader_TextDataManipulation
 
ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATION
You will think of a simple scenario that requires loading and manipulation of text data. For example if you have a personal record of your expenses (month, amount spent, type of expense) stored as an excel file you can manipulate it through JAVA.
The application that you will design must provide menu options to process the loaded data in the following ways:
1. Display all data using formatted output.
2. Sort and display all data using formatted output, using a column of your choice. For example you can display your expenses sorted by month, expense type or amount.
3. Search and display data.
	Start by using one column of your choice as a search criterion. For example you may want to search and display all expenses recorded in November.
	Enhance your code implementation by allowing the user to determine the column which will be used as a search criterion.
4. Display two summarized data/statistics for a column of your choice. For example you may display the total and average expenses.

PART A: 40% 1. Design – REPORT and Data File  Use Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet application to create your data file and then save it as CSV (the name of the file should be yoursurname.csv)  Prepare a document, which should include the following: o Description of the data used. Make sure that you note which symbol is used as a delimiter. o General description of your program, including identification of the columns used for sorting, searching and summarizing data.

Information Technology
2. Implementation Your application should fulfil the following requirements in a coherent way:
1. load the file
2. display a menu for the 4 menu options described above 3. validate all input and provide proper feedback 4. use appropriate exception handling techniques
5. compile successfully (i.e. does not contain any syntax errors)
6. perform all functionality indicated in the menu, with the desired outputs (i.e. does not contain any logic errors)
